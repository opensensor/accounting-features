### Accrual vs Cash Accounting
The eBay integration uses **proper accrual accounting** with two separate events:

#### 1. Sale Transaction (When Customer Purchases)
```
Date: 2025-01-15 (Sale Date)
Description: eBay Sale: Wireless Headphones (buyer123)
Reference: Order #12345

Accounts Receivable - eBay    $95.50  (Debit)
eBay Fees                     $9.50   (Debit)  
Sales Tax Payable             $5.00   (Credit)
Product Sales                 $90.00  (Credit)
Shipping Revenue              $10.00  (Credit)
```

#### 2. Payout Transaction (When eBay Pays You)
```
Date: 2025-01-17 (Payout Date)
Description: eBay payout - Ref #PAYOUT-789

Cash - Business Account       $95.50  (Debit)
Accounts Receivable - eBay    $95.50  (Credit)
```
